# Unstable Batch
Once it is ran, it loops CMD errors (not sure why)
This was not the goal I was trying to achieve, but I thought it was interesting. It caused all themes on my PC to reset and eventually crashed my PC over time.

The worst this can do is crash your PC with a blue screen. It won't modify any files or collect data. The source code is open because it's a batch file. I am not responsible if you use this maliciously.
